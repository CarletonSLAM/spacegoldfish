/*
 * Tiny IO features:
 *
 * - Extremely small memory footprint.  On the Prop, a "Hello World" program
 *   using stdlibc++ takes 500K.  It takes less than 2K by using this header
 *   and the Tiny I/O library.
 *
 * - However, this I/O class is not link-compatible.  In other words, you must
 *   #include <tinystream> instead of #include <iostream>
 *
 * - operator new / operator delete without the exception overhead.  These
 *   "skinny" allocators do have the appropriate signatures and therefore
 *   are link-compatible without including any special header.
